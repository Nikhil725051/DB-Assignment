1. The relationship between the Product and Product_Category entities is one-to-many. A product can belong to one category, but a category can have many products.


2. We can ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it by employing foreign key constraint. The database enforces a foreign key constraint on the category_id column in the Product table. This constraint ensures the referenced category ID exists in the Product_Category table. Any attempt to insert a product with an invalid category ID would be rejected by the database.
